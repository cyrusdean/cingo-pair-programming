# Goal

Create a application that retrieves and displays the user repositories and organisations in Github.

## UX/UI

It should include an input to enter the username, one area to display the repositories of the user and another
area to display the organisations.

## Retrieving data

To make things easier we have commited a github-api.js file with the REST APIs needed to retrieve the information.

## Bootstrapping the project

Use whatever tools you like. This project is equal parts about evaluating your skill and learning about your
prefernces and style.

## Bonus (don't need to be in the below specific order)

- Add an indicator when information is loading
- Deal with errors coming from Github
- Use ES6 syntax including arrow functions, destructuring and async/await
